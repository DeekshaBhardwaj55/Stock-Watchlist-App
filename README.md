# ðŸ“ˆ Stock Watchlist App

A mobile app built with **React Native (Expo)** that allows users to:

- Track top gainers and losers in the stock market
- Create and manage multiple watchlists
- Browse and view real-time stock details
- Add or remove stocks from custom watchlists

Data is fetched using the **Alpha Vantage API**, and watchlists are stored locally using AsyncStorage.
